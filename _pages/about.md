I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau](https://rptu.de/en) supervised by Professor [Christoph Garth](https://vis.cs.rptu.de/team/garth/).
My research interest mainly lie in the area of scientific visualization, especially large-scale data analysis and visualization, topological data analysis and the intersection of those.
